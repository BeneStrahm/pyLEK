# gui
## PyQt5
See https://www.learnpyqt.com/tutorials/first-steps-qt-creator/ or https://likegeeks.com/pyqt5-tutorial to start with the gui

For the design of the gui the PyQt5 designer is recommended.

1) Install PyQt5
pip install PyQt5

2) Install PyQt5 designer
pip install PyQt5-tools

3) Where is PyQt5 designer?
To start search for the path "..\Python\Python39\Scripts\qt5-tools.exe" and start in a terminal with  "..\Python\Python39\Scripts\qt5-tools.exe designer"

The *.ui files created with the PyQt5 designer should be converted using "pyuic5 infile.ui -o outfile.py"

## Matplotlib
Implemented according to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43947318/plotting-matplotlib-figure-inside-qwidget-using-qt-designer-form-and-pyqt5

In order to use a widget created in the PyQt5 designer in matplotlib one needs to "Promote" the blank QtWidget to a MplWidget using the header mplwidget. This works as the following:

1) Add a "widget" in the PyQt5 designer
2) Right click on the widget in the PyQt5 designer - select "Promote to" / "Als Platzhalter f√ºr benutzerdefinierte Klasse festlegen"
3) Under "Promoted Class Name" / "Klassenname" select the class name , hereinafter "MplWidget"
4) Under "Include" select the path and name to the include, hereinafter "sampleCode.gui.mplwidget"
5) Press "Promote" / "Anwenden"
6) Rename the widget-object, hereinafter "MplWidget"

You can easily create multiple widgets showing matplotlib-plots. They all (can) use the same class, since they are simply different objects of the same class. Just make sure that they have a unique object-name (E.g. here "MplWiget_left" and ".._right"), which you then use in your code (see also app_framework.py)

## Layouts
The PyQt5 designer works with layouts. This will ensure that all your widgets will be displayed and resized properly when the form is previewed or used in an application.
